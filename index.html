        <h3>Poker Hands</h3>
        <p class="rules"> 
                Five of a Kind - This is the highest possible hand and can occur only where at least one card is wild, such as a joker. Examples of five of a kind would be four 10s and a wild card or two queens and three wild cards.
                <br>
                Straight Flush - This is the highest possible hand when only the standard pack is used, and there are no wild cards. A straight flush consists of five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 of hearts.
                <br>
                Four of a Kind - This is the next highest hand. An example is four aces or four 3s.
                <br>
                Full House - This colorful hand is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three 8s and two 4s.
                <br>
                Flush - Five cards all of the same suit, but not all in sequence, is a flush. An example is Q, 10, 7, 6, and 2 of clubs.
                <br>
                Straight - Five cards in sequence, but not all of the same suit is a straight. An example is 9♥, 8♣, 7♠, 6♦, 5♥.
                <br>
                Three of a Kind - This combination contains three cards of the same rank, and the other two cards each of a different rank, such as three jacks, a seven, and a four.
                <br>
                Two Pairs - This hand contains a pair of one rank and another pair of a different rank, plus any fifth card of a different rank, such as Q, Q, 7, 7, 4.
                <br>
                One Pair - This frequent combination contains just one pair with the other three cards being of different rank. An example is 10, 10, K, 4, 3.
                <br>
                No Pair - This very common hand contains "nothing." None of the five cards pair up, nor are all five cards of the same suit or consecutive in rank. When more than one player has no pair, the hands are rated by the highest card each hand contains, so that an ace-high hand beats a king-high hand, and so on.   
                        </p>
          <h3>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h3>
        <p class="rules"> 
                 Before and after each card(s) is revealed, players take turns to bet. To stay in the hand and see the next card, all players must have put the same amount of chips in the pot as each other.
                <br>
                The best poker hand wins the pot.
        </p>
          <h3>THE DEAL</h3>
        <p class="rules"> 
                 Every player is dealt two cards, for their eyes only.
                <br>
                The dealer spreads five cards - three at once, then another, then another - which can be used by all players to make their best possible five-card hand.  
        </p>
           <h3>THE PLAY</h3>
        <p class="rules"> 
                 In Hold'em, each player is dealt two private cards (known as ‘hole cards’) that belong to them alone. Five community cards are dealt face-up, to form the ‘board’. All players in the game use these shared community cards in conjunction with their own hole cards to each make their best possible five-card poker hand. In Hold'em, a player may use any combination of the seven cards available to make the best possible five-card poker hand, using zero, one or two of their private hole cards.   
        </p>
           <h6>The Flop</h6>
        <p class="rules"> 
                Now, three cards are dealt face-up on the board. This is known as ‘the flop’. In Hold'em, the three cards on the flop are community cards, available to all players still in the hand. Betting on the flop begins with the active player immediately clockwise from the button. The betting options are similar to pre-flop, however if nobody has previously bet, players may opt to check, passing the action to the next active player clockwise. 
        </p>
           <h6>The Turn</h6>
        <p class="rules"> 
                 When the betting action is completed for the flop round, the ‘turn’ is dealt face-up on the board. The turn is the fourth community card in Hold'em (and is sometimes also called ‘Fourth Street’). Another round of betting ensues, beginning with the active player immediately clockwise from the button.    
        </p>
           <h6>The River</h6>
        <p class="rules"> 
               When betting action is completed for the turn round, the ‘river’ or ‘Fifth Street’ is dealt face-up on the board. The river is the fifth and final community card in a Hold'em game. Betting again begins with the active player immediately clockwise from the button, and the same betting rules apply as they do for the flop and turn, as explained above.
        </p>
